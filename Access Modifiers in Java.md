- Access modifiers: are keywords that control the accessibility of classes, interfaces, variables, methods, constructors, data members, and setter methods.
- There are four access modifiers in Java:
	- public: : This is the most accessible access modifier. A class, variable, method, or constructor declared as public can be accessed from anywhere in the program.
	- private: : This is the least accessible access modifier. A class, variable, method, or constructor declared as private can only be accessed within the class in which it is declared.
	- protected: : This access modifier is in between public and private. A class, variable, method, or constructor declared as protected can be accessed within the class in which it is declared, as well as by subclasses of that class.
	- default: : This is the default access modifier. A class, variable, method, or constructor declared without an access modifier is given the default access modifier. The default access modifier allows access within the same package.
